## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Be specific about layout**: "top left", "middle right", "bottom, wide"
2. **Include formulas in text**: Write them out, the AI will render them visually
3. **Request icons**: "cute calculator icon", "GPU chip icon", "lightning bolt"
4. **Specify style**: "pastel colors", "modern flat design", "clean lines"
5. **Request connections**: "arrows showing flow", "lines connecting related concepts"
6. **Include labels**: Every box should have clear labels
7. **Use numbered sections**: SECTION 1, BOX 1, etc. for structure
8. **Request comparisons**: "compare X vs Y", "show before/after"
9. **Ask for visual examples**: "show small diagram", "include curve illustration"
10. **Specify resolution**: Always use `--resolution 4K` for detailed infographics
